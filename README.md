# Ignore DotEnv - Automatically Add .env to .gitignore & Remove from Git History

A VSCode extension that helps you protect sensitive environment variables by automatically managing `.env` files in `.gitignore`. Never accidentally commit `.env` files to Git again! Also includes a feature to safely remove `.env` files from Git history if they were previously committed.

## üîë Key Features

- üîí **Protect Your Secrets**: Automatically prevents `.env` files from being committed to Git
- üóëÔ∏è **Remove .env from Git History**: One-click solution to remove sensitive `.env` files from Git history (button appears in the bottom-right corner of VSCode)
- üö´ **Automatic .gitignore Management**: Creates or updates `.gitignore` to include `.env`
- ‚ö° **Zero Configuration**: Works instantly when you open a Git repository
- üîç **Smart Detection**: Automatically detects Git repositories and existing `.gitignore` files

## ü§î Why Use This Extension?

- Prevent accidental exposure of API keys, passwords, and sensitive credentials
- Fix security issues when `.env` files are accidentally pushed to GitHub
- Save time by automating `.gitignore` management for environment variables
- Protect your project's security with zero manual configuration
- Remove exposed `.env` files from Git history without losing local changes

## How it Works

The extension activates automatically when you open a Git repository in VSCode:

1. üìù Checks for existing `.gitignore` file
2. ‚ú® Creates `.gitignore` with `.env` entry if it doesn't exist
3. ‚ûï Adds `.env` to existing `.gitignore` if not already present
4. üîî Notifies you when changes are made
5. üßπ Provides a one-click solution to remove `.env` from Git history while keeping your local files intact

## Where to Find the Remove .env Button

When you open a Git repository that has `.env` files in its history:

1. Look at the bottom-right corner of your VSCode window
2. You'll see a "Remove .env from Github History" button
3. Click this button to safely remove `.env` files from your repository's history
4. The button remains visible to ensure you can always clean your Git history when needed

Note: The extension preserves your local `.env` files while ensuring they're not tracked in Git. If you've already committed `.env` files to GitHub, you'll see a convenient button to safely remove them from the repository history.
